## 📖 Overview  
**Weather by Search** is a simple and elegant Flutter application that allows users to search for weather information by **city name** or **postal code**.  
It displays the **current temperature**, **min/max values**, **weather state**, **last updated time**, and a matching **weather image**.  

The app also features a **dynamic theme** and **animated gradient background** that adapt beautifully to the current weather condition — creating an immersive user experience.

## ⚙️ How It Works  
1. The user enters a **city name** or **postal code**.  
2. The app fetches weather data from the **WeatherAPI**.  
3. The **UI updates dynamically** with the current temperature, weather icon, and description.  
4. The **theme and gradient colors** change automatically based on the weather condition code.  
5. Any network or parsing error is handled gracefully with a **custom error widget**.
